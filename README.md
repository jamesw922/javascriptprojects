# javascriptprojects

This is a collection of some of the projects I have done in my quest to become proficient at JavaScript, initially drawn from my work on the FCC challenges and the Traversy Udemy course that struck me in some way.

The FCC material has been quite an experience and I have to say that revisiting past challenges and seeing how my approach has changed is inspirational. Some of these solutions are far from elegant but if I am posting them here I find something in them significant enough to wish to save them for future pondering.
